  My name is David Venuto. I am a Computer Science major in my junior year. Courses that Iâ€™ve taken include CS1, 2 and 3, Object Oriented Programming, Assembly Language, and Discrete/Continuous Algorithms. I would say that the most notable project that I have worked on was this past summer when I was part of a research experience at Columbia University. I engineered a neural network that forecasted Antarctic sea-ice variability on a seasonal timescale in an effort to improve upon a previously created Markov model. We utilized machine learning frameworks in Python (Keras, Tensorflow, etc.) to forecast sea ice concentration anomalies up to 20% more accurately than the previous model. I have continued working on this research through the fall and will continue to work on it during the spring.
	I see myself using the knowledge I gain in this class to hopefully contribute to my career.  I would like to pursue a job in the data science field post-graduation, and I believe this class can help me become stronger in my knowledge of databases and how we interact with them as programmers. Additionally, I would like to independently create my own web-app at some point, so I do believe much of the stuff to be learned in this class will be extremely valuable to me in my own endeavors.
